## `local ui = require'ui'`

Extensible UI toolkit written in Lua with layouts, styles and animations.

## Features:

  * OMG widgets! including a grid and a code editor (seeee the demos!).
  * easily extensible and composable with [oo] and a base layer object.
  * cascading styles with `> parent` and `:state` selectors.
  * transition-based animations.
  * constraint-based, container-based and flow-based layout systems.
